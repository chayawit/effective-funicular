This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this about?
This project is a part of PennX: SD4x course (Programming for the Web with JavaScript) on [edx.org](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PennX+SD4x+2T2017). The activity is to modify the app to make the React components function as instructed. Users can type in a list name to create a new list. In each list, the user can then add list items. When each list item is clicked, it alternates its colour between black and grey.
